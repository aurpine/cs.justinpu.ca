		<h1>Implementation</h1>
		
		<p>Implementation problems are ones where the problem itself is not a challenge, but implementing (coding) the solution may require some thinking or skill. These problems vary a lot and thus have many forms. They are often combined with simulation problems. </p>
        
        <p>There's no better way to learn implementation than with examples. Practicing is also the best way to train your implementation skills. </p>
		
		<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Given a number, count from 1 up to the number. </p>
		
		<p>To solve this problem, use a for loop that counts from 1 up to number and prints output. </p>
		
		<pre><code>get number
for n: 1 to number
    print number, " "
end for</code></pre>
		
		<p>There are other, more difficult problems requiring the use of conditions. </p>
		
		<h2>Switch-Case</h2>
		
		<p>Switch blocks are another type of conditionals statements. These aren't often used, but may be faster. <p>
		
		<p>If we were given a number, either 1, 2 or 3, and had to print A, B and C respectively, this will be very easy with a switch-case block. </p>
		
		<pre><code>switch (num) {
	case 1: print "A"; return;
	case 2: print "B"; return;
	case 3: print "C"; return;
}</pre></code>
		
		<p>A positive feature, although never used, is that after a case is found, it continues running subsequent code. </p>
		
		<p>An example would be if I had 3 types of bags. Bag 1, has an A element. Bag 2 has an A element and a B element. Finally, bag 3 has one of each A, B and C elements. We could then use a switch-case block to find the number of each element there is in a bag. Put this statement in a for loop to find the total number of each element in all the bags. </p>
		
		<pre><code>switch (bag) {
	case 3: C++;
	case 2: B++;
	case 1: A++;
}</pre></code>
		
		<h2>Continuation</h2>
		
		<p>Not all conditionals problems are as easy as these examples. As you continue, these problems require you to use compound conditions and math operations within the conditions. </p>
