		<h1>Types of Problems</h1>
		<p>There are many types of problems in computer science. Here's a list and a brief explanation of them. </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Ad hoc</strong> - uncategorized, these problems vary from problem to problem. An ad hoc problem may require the use of some other concepts. </li>
			<li><strong>Simulation</strong> - the problem discribed is simulated and a result is printed </li>
			<li><strong>Implementation</strong> - a problem that itself may not be difficult, but implementing a solution may pose as a challenge. Requires usage of data structures. </li>
			<li><strong>Computational</strong> - simple mathematical computation problem, may require some analysis of the problem </li>
			<li><strong>Brute force</strong> - trying every single 
			<li><strong>Recursive</strong> - uses recursion to solve the problem like with recursive functions in math, a solution consists of solutions to smaller problems </li>
			<li><strong>Searches</strong> - the problem requires a specific element or value to be found. This category is very broad. </li>
			<li><strong>Greedy</strong> - using short term decisions and assumptions to shortcut to the answer - isn't always right, but fast</li>
			<li><strong>Dynamic programming</strong> - solving and storing previously solved solutions to save time. Works well on recursive problems/solutions. </li>
			<li><strong>Graph theory</strong> - a type of search problem, involving graph nodes/vertices and edges/paths. </li>
			<li>List may be incomplete - more may be added later on</li>
