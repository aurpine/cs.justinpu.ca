	<h1>About the Language</h1>
	<p>
	There are many important similarities differences between Java and C++. 
	This lesson is all about these similarities and differences.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Syntax</h2>
	<p>
	As you may have noticed in the previous lesson. Code in Java and C++ look 
	relatively the same.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>;</code> - the semicolon</li>
		<li><code>? :</code> - ternary operator</li>
		<li><code>{ }</code> - a block</li>
		<li><code>= *= /= += -= %= >>= <<=</code> - assignment operators</li>
		<li><code>== &lt= &gt= !=</code> - boolean operators</li>
		<li><code>,</code> - parameter separators</li>
		<li>etc...</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
	C++ however does have a few additional syntax rules and features. 
	Below is a very basic synopsis of these features and will be discussed 
	in more detail later. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The following code is the C++ equivalent of an import statement
	</p>
	<pre><code>#include &ltiostream&gt</code></pre>
	<p>
	This is an example of pointers and references.
	</p>
	<pre><code>int a = 5;
int *b = &amp;a;</code></pre>
	
	<h2>Files</h2>
	<p>
	Java files have the extension <code>.java</code> and are 
	compiled into <i>bytecode</i> with the extension <code>.class</code>
	</p>
	<p>
	C++ files have the extension <code>.cpp</code> and are compiled 
	into an executable file (<code>.exe</code>). 
	</p>
	<p>
	An executable file can be directly run, while a .class file can not. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>Language Mechanics</h2>
	
	<p>
	Java is a multi-platform language and supports many operating systems. 
	This is accomplished with the use of a virtual machine (JVM) on which 
	all Java programs are run on. This may make execution slow. 
	</p>
	<p>
	C++ on the other hand, doesn't support as many languages. Windows and 
	Linux based systems can run them with ease, but other operating systems 
	such as MacOS aren't as compatible. It runs directly from the operating 
	system and is thus faster than Java, but also potentially harmful.
