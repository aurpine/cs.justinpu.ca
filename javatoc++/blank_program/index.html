		<h1>Making a Blank Program in C++</h1>
		<p>You should be familiar with this Java program</p>
		<pre><code>class Program {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	}
}</pre></code>
		<p>This program does nothing. It's the minimal template for a program.</p>
		<p>Likewise, this is the minimal template program in C++ (or C).</p>
		<pre><code>int main() {
	return 0;
}</pre></code>
		<p>The difference is that in C++, there's a return type, int. Therefore, there must be a return statement. 
		You can in theory return any number, which could be used for debugging, but we often just return 0.</p>
		<p>You also probably noticed that there's no class! In C/C++ not all files are classes. You don't need to 
		encapsulate a main program in a class. It's way simpler in this aspect. </p>
		<p>Just like how you wouldn't make multiple Java programs for a contest problem, you also shouldn't make 
		multiple C++ files.</p>
